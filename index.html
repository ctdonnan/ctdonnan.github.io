								<b>The First Galaxies</b><br>I use optical/NIR surveys from the ground and space to probe the earliest stages of galaxy formation and evolution.  
								I use these surveys to measure how the galaxy population evolves with cosmic time. Primarily, I study the evolution of the UV luminosity function and cosmic star-formation rate density at z=8-15 using <i>JWST</i>/NIRCam surveys such as PRIMER, JADES, NGDEEP and CEERS. In 
								<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.518.6011D/abstract">Donnan et al. (2023)</a> we presented a combination of a new sample of ultra-luminous galaxies at z=8-10 from ~1.8 sq. degrees of ground based imaging in COSMOS (using UltraVISTA), in combination with one of the first samples
								of galaxies at z>9 from JWST. This reaffirmed the lack of evolution in the bright end of the LF as well as showing a slow evolution overall between z=9-15.

								
							
								
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Galaxy Evolution in the Cosmic Web</b><br>On the largest scales, galaxies are distributed into a web-like structure of dense nodes connected by filaments and separated by vast voids. 
								Using large spectroscopic galaxy surveys such as SDSS and DESI as well as cosmo-hydro simulations such as Illustris TNG, I explored the link between how galaxies evolve and their position relative to features of this large-scale structure. 
								In SDSS and IllustrisTNG we showed that galaxies, independent of overdensity and stellar mass, have higher gas-phase metallicities close to nodes with a weaker relationship present with filaments.
